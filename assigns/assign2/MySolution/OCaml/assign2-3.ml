Please implement foldleft_to_iforeach that turns a
foldleft-loop into a iforeach-loop:
let
foldleft_to_iforeach
(foldleft: ('xs, 'x0, int) foldleft): ('xs, 'x0) iforeach = ...
*)

#use "./../../../../classlib/OCaml/MyOCaml.ml"

let foldleft_to_iforeach (foldleft: ('xs, 'x0, int) foldleft): ('xs, 'x0) iforeach =
  fun xs work -> 
    let _ = foldleft xs 0 (fun i x -> (work i x; i+1)) in ()
